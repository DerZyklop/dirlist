# sass-boilerplate

This is my personal sass-boilerplate. It's assembled with my constantly recurring css. All the styles are bundled into 'mixins'. Most of the 'mixins' uses variables (e.g. for radii, sizes, colors), that are 	arranged in the '_variables.sass'-file. So it is very easy to setup the css-basics at the begin of a new project.

Maybe it helps someone to create his/her own sass-dummy. I wouldn't recommend to use it as it is for your project. As long as it's in version 0.X, it's in an early, messy developement-status. I have to clean it up and figure out the best practice.
